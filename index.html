                        <h2>Our Project Report</h2>

                        <h3>Group Processes</h3>

                        <p class="section-description">Our team worked extremely well over the weeks leading up to the due date of assignment 2, our group actually started at about week 2. we formed a team on Discord and have been helping each other with problems since then. Own team
                            was down to 4/6, so we had to split the workload among the remaining members. This did not bring the teams moral down. We started getting work done, then we suddenly we lost another member due to a personal reason. The remaining
                            members worked together and came up with a finished product. It was great as a small team to see how much we could get done in such a short amount of time.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Career Plan</h3>

                        <p class="section-description">Our teams’ ideal jobs are different in the job search seen but 3 of them are somewhat the same. Brandon is the only one who chose an IT consultant as an ideal job. James, Jamie and Ryan have similar job fields as developers. Brandon
                            Job he wants to pursue involves general IT solutions from giving advice to clients on their Technology systems, to helping other organizations use IT to manage business processes.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">James has chosen to pursue a path of Junior Developer, as a junior dev he would have such tasks as reviewing code and pairing it with mid to senior level developers as to gain more knowledge of various coding languages. As a junior
                            dev you could also have roles in QA to finding bugs and testing the product.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">Ryan and Jamie both have the sane ideal job and that is a full stack developer. This job is including building software and websites on the front and the backend. The backend is about building the foundation of any website or program
                            as the frontend is the visible part of the website or program. This position requires a lot more time and practise to put all these systems together.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">Most of our ideal jobs as pretty much the same but there is one main difference between an IT consultant and developer is a dev is the one to initiate the coding for the website or program. The IT consultant can help with code
                            reviews and code re-factoring. The IT consultant can also plan a timeline for project, assist in security problems and train staff to use new IT systems.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Topic</h3>

                        <p class="section-description">Our group ‘Newb Entity’ has decided to make a web application. This application allows the users to generate their own Dungeons and Dragons campaign.The app’s main feature is the Campaign Builder, which allows users to generate
                            a Dungeons & Dragons campaign based on the user’s inputs. The user can choose the setting and theme of the campaign, as well as the level of the adventurers who will be carrying out the campaign. The speed and flexibility of
                            the Campaign Builder makes it a powerful tool in the hands of any Dungeon Master, whether they be new to D&D or a seasoned veteran.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">Additional features such as a D&D focused social interaction platform give this project of ours the potential to connect D&D players from around the world. They would be encouraged to share their experiences, stories and expertise
                            to any new players who want to become a part of the fascinating world of Dungeons & Dragons. The ultimate goal of this project is to simplify campaign creation, and to connect adventurers of all levels of experience to unite
                            them in a single, purpose built online community.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Motivation</h3>

                        <p class="section-description">The biggest motivation that has encouraged our group to create such an online program, comes from our team’s passion in Dungeons and Dragons. Due to our team’s interest in Dungeons and Dragons, and the get togethers our members
                            do every week, has kept us all motivated and excited to bring this wonderful project to the D&D community, it is because of this reason that this project is important to our group.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">Our groups project fits in with current IT trends, because, there is a constant rise of Dungeons and Dragons players, and having such a huge fanbase, D&D will always have new players, experienced players as well as returning players,
                            who are trying to find a new and easier way to learn the game and connect to the rest of the community. If a future employer was to examine our project, it would show that we the ability to work as a team to create a project
                            that will benefit people all around the world.
                        </p>

                        <h3>landscape</h3>

                        <p class="section-description">The only similar products that our group has been able to find online are, websites that give two to three story plots for players to build their own campaign from. If our research is correct, then our groups idea of building an
                            actual campaign generator that takes users inputs to generate a complete campaign, is a one of a kind project. Due to designing an online Dungeons and Dragons community, there are bound to be competitors, however, because of
                            the function of our project, we believe, that our website will stand out from all the rest, and that will help draw in the community.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Detailed Description</h2>

                        <h3>Aims</h3>

                        <p class="section-description">The aim for DnD campaign generator is to provide a dungeon master with a 5th edition adventure for them to run with either their friends or family. You can either be a very experienced dungeon master or a Beginner. This tool will
                            give you the basic information needed to set out on your very own adventure. It also gives you randomised monsters that you will be able to encounter to spice that game night you might have planned.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">One goal we have for our project is more settings and themes for the campaign generator. One thing I find hard when trying to figure out where I want to make the campaign/adventure is, do I want it in a harsh rugged mountain top?
                            Or maybe a lush and vibrant rain forest? Who knows that’s up to the person using the application. That’s why this goal will be to make sure that there is something that will make your imagination run wild. In the future we
                            want to see features added in that lets you pick multiply themes. So that once you pass through that mountain, they might end up in a forest surrounded by tall trees and lakes to passing though towns and cities. We would like
                            to see our project grow like the adventures the players will take. Other goal for this project our group has had in mind is adding items into the mix. Being able to add all the 5th edition items from the game into our application,
                            would see players being able add items to Their playable characters and even for the dungeon master to assign loot for defeating monsters or solving puzzles and riddles. In addition to items it would be able to assign currency
                            to players and monsters. Giving the dungeon master a tool to distribute currency to players or working out how much gold that dragon was hoarding.
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">A very distant goal for our application would be the dungeon/map maker. It would be a tool that allows you to create a landscape for your adventure, it would have such feature like;
                            <li class="section-description">Gridlines to give a distance guide,</li>
                            <li class="section-description">Ability to add walls and doors,</li>
                            <li class="section-description">Add monsters and obsticles,</li>
                            <li class="section-description">Add items like chests of treasure,</li>
                            <li class="section-description">Add non playable characters (NPC's),</li>
                            <li class="section-description">Add buildings and paths and,</li>
                            <li class="section-description">Add trees and boulders to navigate.</li>
                        </p>

                        <p class="section-description">This visual tool would be a great addition to our application to get the user immersed into what they are creating and give a visual guide to help the dungeon master navigate the adventure they want their players to take.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>

                        <p class="section-description">




                            <h2>Roles</h2>

                            <p class="section-description">Our project has 4 members in it, there roles are as follows. The Lead developer is James, his job is to write all the code for our application. This is the hardest task in our project because he is the only one that knows how
                                to string everything we want to do. Marketing and sales are done by Ryan, his role is to make sure the world sees our product, to make videos and articles relating to our project to ensure that we have a footprint in the
                                world. It is a hard job because he needs to make sure the content that he is producing is connecting to all types of people looking for a D&D campaign generator.
                            </p>

                            <p class="section-description">The customer support and testing are done by Brandon, his roles is to take the feedback and enquiries from the consumers to ensure that they are having the best experience possible. Another part of Brandon’s role is to work
                                with James to ensure that the feedback and bugs are sorted out, once they have been rectified Brandon then tests the application to ensure it is up to scratch to release back to the consumers. Web design and development
                                is done by Jamie. His role is to make sure the website is looking clean and laid out in such a manner that it’s easy for the consumer to read and follow. Another role for Jamie is to make sure that the website is managed
                                and hosted constantly to ensure everyone has access all the time.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

                            <p class="section-description">It wasn’t so much limit but more limitations, we had to many ideas at once and needed to scale the project back to just a simple application. So, we went with just making a simple campaign generator for the time being. We were
                                also limited time wise, so we needed to get a few monster stats into the application to produce a few adventures for players to embark on. The scope of the project was to have a barebones working application by the end
                                of this assignment. So, this would include a working UI and a few adventures thought of. We have achieved this goal and now we have a working prototype that someone can access our website and generate an adventure that
                                can be played straight away. Another section of the application was to put in dungeon master notes so they could have all the information in front of them to set the scene and act on any question asked of them. The next
                                part limitation was not being able to implement the loot system. We wanted the dungeon master to be able to have the loot in front of them on the PDF, but due to complicated limitations of D&D classes in-game it was hard
                                to get it working in such a short amount of time.
                            </p>

                            <h2> Tools and Technologies</h2>

                            <p class="section-description">The front end of our application revolves around React 16.8.6, Redux 4.0.1, HTML 5, ECMA Script 10, and Sass-loader 7.1.0, which is all consolidated using Webpack 4.29.6 with plugins like @babel/core 7.4.0 that allow our application
                                to use modern JavaScript features and transform them into backwards compatible polyfills older web browsers can understand. A /src folder in the application's root is converted into bundles and moved into a /dist folder
                                to be served by Node.
                            </p>

                            <p class="section-description">The back end uses Node 8.11.4 and Express 4.16.4. This backend uses Axios 0.19.0 to make HTTP requests to a third-party API called dnd5eapi.co to return game-specific datasets like monsters, items, and spells in JSON [1]. When
                                the user loads the UI, the UI makes its first get request to the DND API and stores the results in the application's state. No database is necessary, nor is local storage or cookies needed.

                            <p class="section-description">The application is hosted on Heroku for free and hits the 1 second page-load benchmark without further optimizations necessary. The reason this application loads so quickly is because it defaults to a compression type developed
                                by Google called Brotli, and should this not be supported, it sends GZipped files instead [2].

                            <p class="section-description">We can see that the entire application is placed into an iframe and that the compressed file size of the bundles that power this app are only 83.85kbs compared to a total file size of 440.18kbs uncompressed. That's an 80.95%
                                decrease in file size, which is absolutely amazing technology. All of the tools and technology that power this application are free and production ready. This application is so light weight that a Heroku free account packs
                                more than enough punch to keep up with requests; however, hosting will need to be scaled as use increases.

                            <h2>Testing</h2>

                            <p class="section-description">This application has already undergone informal Ad Hoc testing [3] where I, the developer, have intentionally attempted to break the application. This resulted in the discovery of bugs early on that I was able to fix before
                                the rest of the team had the chance to experience them. Likewise, I have done rudimentary usability testing, and the application has been used and tested by 7 other people, which is okay coverage at this point of prototyping.
                                In the future, I will write proper unit tests using a framework / test runner called Jest [4]. This will enable me to write basic assertions. For example, I would expect that when the /getMonsters route on the server is
                                contacted, it will return an object containing three arrays that each contain three monsters, and I would expect that after clicking the Generate Campaign button that #campaignText and #campaignHeader divs are not blank.

                            <p class="section-description">This application already supports linting using the stringent guidelines [5] established by Airbnb’s development team. Implementing both unit testing and a uniform code style will facilitate higher quality software with fewer
                                bugs. Finally, I would make a call out and offer a bug bounty to any security consultant who can successfully hack our server. Although we do not hold a user's personal information in any form, it still wouldn't be ideal
                                if our server were to be rooted and defaced.

                            <h2>Risks</h2>

                            <p class="section-description">The single biggest risk of this project is relying on a third-party API to serve application-critical information. This is easy to solve. dnd5eapi.co API can be cloned directly from the GitHub repository, and their entire database
                                self-hosted. I would be deploying a copy to Azure and only redirecting requests to this resource if a request to dnd5eapi.co should fail, which allows us to save on deployment costs while still covering our bases in a failure.
                                <br></br>Additionally, there is a chance Heroku could go down. I would have to write a client-side script that tests if our Heroku-hosted server is accessible, and if it's not, use a different server hosted on Microsoft
                                Azure. Again, not using paid resources as our primary resources will keep costs down. I don't foresee our users exceeding the limitations of Heroku's free resources for quite some time, but I will have to monitor traffic
                                closely and provision additional resources as demand increases.
                                <br></br>Regarding development time, there is quite a lot of core features left to implement. The existing application is still a toy, and there's a significant amount of creative writing time in addition to writing the
                                code itself, so it would be prudent to unload some of the creative writing to the core team as well as explore hiring freelance writers; this will mitigate the risk of the lead developer burning out. Finally, the risk with
                                every project is that the project will not get off the ground. Given this project can be implemented for zero cost, the only thing we stand to lose is time and invested emotions should this project fail to gain traction,
                                but at the very least, we all gain a nice portfolio piece to decorate our resumes.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Group Process and Communications</h2>

                            <p class="section-description">Group communication occurs daily over Discord in both a formal and informal context. We're not just colleagues, but also friends. This has both advantages and disadvantages. Working with friends can be nice for morale and comradery,
                                but it's also difficult to reprimand a friend if that becomes necessary. Our group has already shown more than adequate conflict resolution skills despite an informal working environment, having worked together in previous
                                assignments. We have had difficulties with group members taking extended periods of absence without explanation, and we've dealt with this by making contact as many times as necessary to get a response.
                                <br></br>Moving forward, it would be wise to establish additional channels of communication. An exchange of mobile numbers would allow us to reduce response time should a team member become occupied with other obligations.
                                Formal allocation of tasks with expected deadlines is another strategy we could implement to better guarantee every group member understands their obligations and has a clear task to work towards. In the past, tasks have
                                been distributed on a volunteer basis, but this might not be the most effective approach because it's too easy to get distracted by other obligations and end up with contribution imbalance that adversely affects the team.
                                When meetings are absolutely essential and need to be planned, the approach we use is to designate a day and time that's mutually convenient and show up. This has been more than adequate for our group.

                        <p class="section-description">Things in our group went well, the work we did for this assignment was hard, but we got through it as a team. Our team only had one goal and that was to make a working application that someone could actually use, and I think we
                            achieved this well. Communication could have been better within the team, there was a few times we didn’t hear from members for days and it sort of slowed the assignment process down a little. One thing that was surprising
                            was that we now have a working application setup on a website for people to interact and use on a daily basis. The thing about teams and how great teams really work is teamwork. It is the essential part of any group of people
                            trying to achieve the same goals. Constant communication between any team is always good too. Because that’s how we ended up with a finished product. By always talking about how we can create and making our project better and
                            more user friendly.

                        <h3>Brandon Anderson</h3>

                        <p class="section-description">Assignment 3 started off extremely well with all 4 of our members spit balling ideas and settling on one idea. After the first week it went a little slow due to our members having things on in their life, however this didn’t slow
                            us down.
                            <br></br>
                            Due to the topic of our idea of creating a DnD Campaign Generator, James, Jamie and Ryan were in their element because of their love for Dungeons and Dragons, for me however since I have never played it was extremely fun learning about the game. As for
                            teamwork, our group worked well together to get everything done on time. We had a few ups and downs along the way but not enough to stop us.
                            <br></br>
                            Throughout this Assignment our group ran into a few problems, which I believe was caused from not enough communication. Due to this miscommunication we struggled a bit trying to get everyone on the same track, however this issue was solved, and everything
                            ran smoothly from there on. This Assignment took place through some unfortunate events in my life, due to this, I was unable to help out as much as I would have liked. However, whenever I got the change, I tried my best to
                            help out.

                        <p class="section-description">
                            I have enjoyed being a part of this team for this subject. Each member has unique ideas and we’re all comfortable with sharing them with each other. The goal for this subject was to make an application that could realistically be made into a real world
                            product, and I think we have more than achieved that, with each team member contributing great ideas to the project and being eager to learn how to modify the team’s website. One of us even made a phenomenal working prototype,
                            which has been a very valuable contribution to the assignment.
                            <br><br> Discord has been great for team communication. Due to personal circumstances, I was at times unable to communicate with the team. In hindsight I could have made more of an effort to stay in regular contact, and this
                            has ceratinly been a learning experience for me. I am grateful that my team has been understanding and determined to carry out the project’s goal during these times.

                            As a group we chose a project that we all mutually find engaging as fans of role-playing games. We were initially concerned that because a large proportion of our time was going to be spent developing our application rather than working on the report,
                            that we would really struggle being down an entire team member in an already small team; however, everyone pulled together, picked up the extra slack, and finished their assigned tasks.
                            <br></br>
                            The application could be improved as we only had time to implement two of three core features, those features being modular campaigns and scaled randomised monsters. We would have loved to have finished loot generation because the application would feel
                            really fleshed out at that point, but the sheer volume of creative writing necessary app meant James had to write 10 pages at 4,776 words to generate three * three modular campaigns, which was taxing on time, and he did find
                            it surprising that coding the application was much, much easier than the creative writing.
                            <br></br>
                            Regarding groups, we learned that the communication platform we chose worked amazing across different time zones, and schedules as it was very easy to log progress. As a group everyone enjoyed this project. Initially we were concerned that because a large
                            proportion of time was going to be spent developing our application rather than working on the report, that we would really struggle being down an entire team member in an already small team; however, everyone pulled together,
                            picked up the extra slack, and finished their assigned tasks. One thing that went well was development of the website. It has a theme relevant to the nature of the project and flows all the way to the bottom of the page.

                        with a group of some amazing guys, and we're making good progress together.

                    <p class="section-description">Hello, I'm Jamie. I live in Tasmania and used to be a recovery mechanic (heavy vehicle tow truck driver) in the Aust army, but now drive trucks for Toll. I like to play rugby and video games. I also like to build computers. I have
                        always wanted to study I.T. but I left school before I could get an ATAR score. So, I waited until I was a mature age student to apply. I know how components go together, but I would like to see how they interact with each other.
                        I also have a pretty keen interest in web design and development. The only I.T. experience I have is building computers, making a basic (simple) website due to this course and some basics skills in high school. I'm glad I found
                        a good group in this course they have taught me a great deal in a short amount of time and wouldn't be here without them.

                    <p class="section-description">I'm Ryan, I was born and raised in Wollongong, Australia. Before studying IT, I studied physics and Japanese, and I play the guitar in my free time. My interest in IT started when I was only four years old. I remember making artwork
                        in MS Paint and playing Minesweeper. Growing up, I would spend a lot of time on a Windows 2000 PC, mainly talking to friends and playing games. Eventually I wanted a more powerful gaming PC, so I got all the parts I would need
                        and assembled the computer with my Dad’s help. I gained a basic knowledge of the components in a PC and their functions, and I was able to swap out parts and perform maintenance by myself. I've since gained experience with JavaScript
                        and Object-Oriented programming in Java.
